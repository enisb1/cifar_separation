# cifar_separation
This project, developed for the Introduction to Machine Learning course (2024/2025) of the Computer Science Bachelor's program at the University of Bologna, focused on image separation using deep learning techniques. Two images from the CIFAR-10 dataset were merged into a single composite image, and a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras was trained to disentangle the composite back into the two original images. The work explored convolutional architectures capable of learning to recover distinct visual features from overlapping data, demonstrating how deep learning can be applied to inverse problems in computer vision.
